If you instead of a map gets a gray background with a warning, then you may have exceeded the number of free accesses to the Google Maps API.

The google map instrument uses the Google Map API Version 3.

Google has changed the Google Maps API on June 22nd 2016, requiring a mandatory Google API key for all sites, which call the Google Maps API services for the first time after June 22nd 2016.

If you're using the API under the standard plan, you must use an API key set up in a project of your choice.

Users of the standard API:

    Free until exceeding 25,000 map loads per 24 hours.
